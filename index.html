Donlin?</a> - Sited deep in the Bush of Southwestern Alaska, the Donlin
Gold prospect is the largest proposed gold mine in Alaska’s history.
However, an overwhelming majority of Alaskan residents are unfamiliar

Government: Act now on the Climate Emergency</a> - Now that Parliament
has declared a Climate Emergency, we need you to act like it. For
starters, that means banning all new oil and gas production in the UK,
including fracking, tripling renewable energy by 2030, planting 700
million trees, introducing a Frequent Flyer Tax, ending the sale of all
new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and more.</p></li>

Removal</a> - <a
href="https://www.ussdams.org/our-news/americas-aging-dams-in-need-of-repair/">70
percent of the dams in the United States</a> are now more than 50 years
old, with almost 2,000 of them rated as “high-hazard”. About <a
href="https://apnews.com/75b1cd657f3e4fa3be6adaf968eb7df4">1,000 dams
have failed</a> over the past four decades, killing 34 people, and now
many are no longer adequate to handle the intense rainfall and floods of
a changing climate. With dams causing wild salmon populations to go
extinct, their only benefit is hydropower, yet dams are woefully
inefficient by modern standards. For example, the Tugalo Dam in Georgia
destroyed 597 acres of temperate rainforest to produce 45 Megawatts,
which is the equivalent of 7,500 homes adding 6kw rooftop solar panels.
We should tear down these dams as soon as possible, be that when their
contract runs out or sooner, instead of wasting tax-payer money
operating them or trying to revive them. <a

together to form Oceanic Society, the first non-profit organization in

public awareness and political action to issues of ocean health and to
grow the global community of people working toward improved ocean
stewardship. Oceanic Society helped put ocean conservation on the public
radar. Some of our many accomplishments include: Creating the Oceanic
Society Patrol and Farallon Patrol, pioneering ecotourism and volunteer
